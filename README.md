## Key Results

| Metric | Result | Description |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üìà Revenue Growth | **+15%** in Ticket Sales | Enabled by confidently selling tickets predicted to become available, capturing previously lost demand. Confirmed via A/B testing. |
| üí∞ Average Order Value | **+40%** Increase | A direct result of guaranteeing paired seating for families and groups, which encourages larger transactions and improves the fan experience. |
| üéØ Forecast Accuracy | **85%** Accuracy | The ML model's predictions significantly outperformed internal domain experts (65% accuracy) and simple averages (45%). |
| ‚≠ê Fan Experience | Paired Seating Guaranteed | Transformed the fan purchase journey. Users buy for a zone, not a specific seat, and are guaranteed paired seats assigned 24-48 hours before the match. |
| üì¢ Marketing Efficiency | Improved ROAS **14%** | A wider time window to market the match allows for more effective campaign planning, better segmentation, and improved Return on Ad Spend. |
| üõ°Ô∏è Fraud Reduction | Mitigated Scalping | By delaying the issuance of final tickets until just before kick-off, the system combats fraud and gives a competitive advantage over secondary markets. |

## Overview

The core business problem originates with the club's membership model. Approximately 85% of the stadium's 99,000+ seats are allocated to season ticket holders ("members"). This leaves only about 9,500 seats available for general sale from day one. Members who cannot attend a match can release their seat back to the club for resale via the `Seient Lliure` ("Free Seat") program.

However, member behavior creates a massive supply-demand gap: **on average, 40% of seats are freed up within the last 72 hours of a match**, while fan demand is highest weeks in advance. This mismatch leads to lost revenue, a poor fan experience with "sold-out" messages, and fragmented single seats that are hard to sell.

The SmartBooking engine was designed to bridge this gap. It acts as a forecasting layer, using machine learning to generate a **recommendation** on how many seats will become available. A **Ticketing Manager** then reviews this forecast, applies business logic and safety margins, and makes the final decision on how much inventory to push to the live ticketing system. This "human-in-the-loop" approach combines predictive power with expert oversight.

| üö© The Problem | üí° The Solution |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **"Sold Out" Illusion**: Fans faced "Sold Out" messages, unaware that thousands of seats appear in the last 72 hours. | **Advance Availability**: Predicts final seat count weeks in advance, allowing the club to sell tickets for seats that are not yet officially released. |
| **Lost Revenue**: High, early demand went unmet due to the delay in seat returns, leading to significant lost revenue for the club. | **Revenue Capture**: Unlocks millions in sales by matching early fan demand with manager-approved predicted inventory. |
| **Poor Fan Experience**: The unpredictable nature of ticket availability frustrated fans and fueled secondary resale markets. | **Guaranteed Experience**: Offers fans, especially families and groups, guaranteed paired seating, improving satisfaction and trust. |
| **Seat Fragmentation**: Last-minute releases often resulted in many isolated single seats that were difficult to sell. | **Optimized Occupancy**: By selling seats early and guaranteeing pairs, the system reduces empty singles and maximizes attendance. |

The diagram below illustrates the supply-demand gap the system was built to solve. The engine forecasts the final supply (the peak of the blue curve) and makes that inventory available to meet the high early demand (the red line).

## Architecture

The general workflow is as follows:
1.  **Data Sources** are ingested, focusing on historical `Seient Lliure` patterns and contextual match data.
2.  The **Forecasting Engine** generates a seat availability forecast that is delivered as a recommendation to the Ticketing Manager.
3.  The **Ticketing Manager** reviews the forecast, applies a safety buffer, and pushes the final, approved inventory to the **Ticketing System**.

## Dataset

To showcase the model's capabilities, this repository uses a synthetically generated dataset engineered to mirror the complexity and statistical properties of real-world `Seient Lliure` data. The feature set is based directly on the variables used in the production model, which are grouped into logical categories to capture every angle of the problem.

By combining historical data with external factors like match importance and weather, we can build a feature set that accurately predicts a member's likelihood of releasing their seat.

</br>

The model uses a wide range of features, categorized to ensure a holistic view of supply and demand drivers.

| Category | Features | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Match** | Day/Month/Time, Competition, Days-to-match, # Matchday | Core temporal and event-specific details. |
| **Rival** | Position, Points/Goals difference, FIFA ranking, # Trophies, Derby/Cl√°sico | Quantifies the opponent's quality and the match's importance. |
| **Bar√ßa Momentum**| Bar√ßa Position, Last result, Goals +/-, Top player injured | Captures the team's current form and fan excitement. |
| **Sales and Stock** | Sales historical data, Free-up seats historical data, Ticket prices | Historical supply, demand, and pricing information. |
| **Members and Zones**| Max/Avg free-up per zone, Type of member, Zone, `Seient Lliure` incentives | Member-specific behavior and zone-level characteristics. |
| **Web** | Navigational data, User segmentation, Visits to checkout | Digital analytics signals indicating purchase intent. |
| **Weather** | Storm, Rain, Wind | Weather forecasts that can influence a local member's decision to attend. |
| **External Factors**| Holidays, Day before holiday, Political disturbances, New player(s) | Macro-level factors that can impact attendance. |

- **`final_released_seats`** (Integer): **(Target Variable)** The final, total number of seats that were released by season ticket holders in that zone for that match. This is the value the model aims to predict.

</details>

### Match Excitement Factor

To create a realistic dataset, the generation script doesn't just create random numbers. Instead, it simulates the underlying market dynamics by creating a unified **"Match Excitement Factor"**. This single, powerful variable acts as the primary driver for most of the demand signals in the dataset.

This systemic approach ensures that the relationships between the features in the synthetic dataset are correlated in a logical and realistic way, making it a robust foundation for building and testing a demand forecasting model.

## Modeling

The modeling approach is designed to accurately solve a single, critical business problem: predicting the final number of seats that will become available from season ticket holders. This is a classic supervised regression problem. By deconstructing the problem into its key drivers, we can build a model that reliably forecasts this supply.

This approach creates a predictive asset that the business can use to make proactive decisions, turning a forecasting model into a direct revenue-generating tool.

### üìà Availability Forecasting

> This stage answers the business question: *"For a given match, how many season ticket seats will ultimately be returned to the club?"*

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Model** | An **`XGBoost` Regressor**. |
| **Rationale** | After exploring several algorithms (including Decision Trees and Neural Networks), XGBoost was chosen for its high performance, speed, and its ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships. It effectively models how factors like opponent strength, day of the week, and team performance interact to influence a member's decision to release their seat. |
| **Features** | The model uses a rich set of features including match context (`opponent_tier`), temporal factors (`days_until_match`), team performance (`team_position`), and external factors (`holidays`) to build a comprehensive view of the drivers behind seat availability. |
| **Application** | The model's forecast is delivered as a **recommendation** to the Ticketing Manager. A safety buffer (e.g., 95% of the forecast) is manually applied by the manager to mitigate risk before the final inventory is pushed live. |
| **Design Choice** | While time-series models could model release patterns over time, a gradient boosting model like `XGBoost` is better suited to predict a single, final outcome (total released seats) based on a wide array of static features for a given match. It excels at capturing the combined impact of all variables at once. |

The success of the SmartBooking system hinges on the accuracy of its core forecast. The model was evaluated against simpler benchmarks to prove its value.

| Source of Prediction | Accuracy |
| :--- | :--- |
| Averages (Mean, Median, etc.) | 45% |
| Domain Experts | 65% |
| **Machine Learning Model** | **85%** |

*Table: Comparison of prediction accuracy across different methods.*

The model's **85% accuracy** was deemed highly successful, providing a strong statistical foundation for the business to act on the forecasts with confidence. The model was also interpreted using **SHAP values** to ensure the relationships it learned were logical and explainable to stakeholders.

### Validation

Validating the model's business impact required moving beyond simple accuracy metrics to rigorously measure its causal effect on revenue. The core question was: "**Does using this model's forecast cause an increase in revenue?**"

To answer this, we implemented a two-fold validation framework. This approach confirmed a **+15% increase in total ticket sales revenue**, directly attributable to the SmartBooking system.

<details>
<summary><b>Click to see the full validation framework</b></summary>

#### 1. Deconstruct the System: The Validation Strategy

The first step was to frame the problem correctly. A simple A/B test comparing different matches is invalid due to confounding variables (opponent quality, weather, etc.). Our strategy therefore combined offline and online validation.

* **Offline Validation (Pre-Flight Check):** Before any real-world testing, we performed rigorous backtesting on historical data. This involved training the model on a period of data and evaluating its forecast accuracy on a hold-out set. We used SHAP values to interpret the model's predictions, ensuring it learned logical patterns and wasn't relying on spurious correlations. This validated the model's fundamental soundness.

* **Online Validation (Causal Impact Measurement):** To measure the real-world impact, we implemented a quasi-experimental design using **Propensity Score Matching (PSM)**. This statistical technique allowed us to create a fair, "apples-to-apples" comparison group from historical data, effectively simulating a controlled experiment to isolate the model's causal effect on revenue.

#### 2. Quantify the Components: The Execution Plan

This phase involved executing the PSM design to get a reliable measurement of the financial lift.

* **Define Groups**: We established two groups for our analysis:
    * **Treatment Group**: A set of recent matches where the Ticketing Manager used the SmartBooking forecast to release inventory.
    * **Control Group**: A large pool of historical matches from seasons where the SmartBooking system did not exist.

* **Build the Propensity Model**: We built a supervised classification model to calculate a "propensity score" for every match in both groups. This score quantifies the character of each match based on its features (opponent tier, competition, day of the week, etc.), representing the probability of it receiving the "treatment."

* **Match & Compare**: Using a nearest-neighbor matching algorithm, we found a "statistical twin" from the control group for each match in the treatment group. This twin was the historical match with the most similar propensity score, ensuring the comparison was fair.

* **Define KPIs**: We measured the difference between the matched pairs across several metrics:
    * **Primary KPI**: Total Ticket Revenue.
    * **Secondary KPIs**: Final Attendance Rate, Average Order Value (AOV), and the sell-through rate of the predicted inventory.

This rigorous process gave us high confidence that the measured uplift was due to the SmartBooking system and not external factors.
